		<h1 style="color: white;">WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE LIVING?</h2>
		<p style="color: white;">The drive for economic growth has resulted in problems such as environmental degradation and social disparities. Sustainable development prescribes for a more balanced approach to growth that progresses development across three underlying pillars: social inclusion, environmental sustainability and economic prosperity.</p>

	<div id="Difference"> 
		<h1 style="color: white;">SUSTAINABLE LIVING VS. ZERO WASTE---WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?</h2>
		<p style="color: white;">While they have many of the same practices, sustainable living and zero-waste are not the same. People trying to lead a more sustainable life aim to reduce their overall environmental impact in many ways, whereas the focus of the zero-waste movement is to reduce the amount of trash they produce, especially with respect to single-use plastic.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Eating a Plant-Based Diet</th>
				<th>Composting</th>
				<th>Reducing Single-use plastics</th>
				<th>Transportation</th>
				<th>Shopping</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>A plant-based diet means eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, legumes, nuts, and seeds. 
					You should minimize your intake of animal foods like meat, eggs, and dairy, but you don't need to exclude these foods entirely.</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>Compost is organic material that can be added to soil to help plants grow. Food scraps and yard waste together currently make up more than 30 percent of what we throw away, and could be composted instead. Making compost keeps these materials out of landfills where they take up space and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>This expansion exceeds population growth, and is the result of a disposable-goods system that combines short-term use and long-term environmental harm. Half of all plastic production is for single-use items. To get a sense of how ephemeral a “single use” can be, consider that the average working life of a disposable plastic shopping bag is just 15 minutes.</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					If you drive a gas-powered car every day, consider alternatives with lower emissions if they are available to you. For example, try walking, riding a bike, taking public transportation, carpooling, or investing in an electric or hybrid car when you need a new one. Additionally, many environmentalists have given up flying in airplanes (such as Greta Thunberg) due to the high environmental footprint, so consider traveling by train instead of by air when possible.
				</td>
				<td>
					The most sustainable form of shopping is not to shop at all — and the second most sustainable form (and more realistic form) of shopping is shopping secondhand. Before buying anything new, check out your local thrift store, websites and apps like Poshmark, Craigslist, or eBay, or your local Buy Nothing group on Facebook. When it comes to items that you can’t buy secondhand, seek out companies that make products from natural or recycled materials while following sustainable business practices.

            <p>
              With climate change becoming a more serious problem every day, it’s now more important than ever for people to do their part to reduce their environmental impact. Demanding lawmakers and corporations institute laws or policies to help with that is extremely important, but lowering your personal impact can make a huge difference as well.

		<h1 style="color: white;">IMPACT OF SUSTAINABLE LIVING</h2>
		<p style="color: white;">The environment has become a topic of great discussion for the 21st century, with the growing awareness of the public on the condition of our environment and the resources that we have available to us. One question that scientists have been debating is the likelihood of sustainable development, which is the process of advancing technology, increasing revenue, and improving the standards of living without causing environmental degradation or depleting the resources of the earth. </p>

	<div>
		<h1 style="color: white;">WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO</h2>
		<p style="color: white;">As the discussion above indicates, a sustainable development agenda requires tradeoffs across three components: economic, social and environmental. For example, eradicating poverty is accompanied by more intensive farming methods; the rising middle class leads to more industrialization and/or growing cities. Each of these changes come at an environmental cost. So the interlinkages between economic, social and environmental issues need to be considered.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>
				<h3>Grow Food</h3>
				<p>Growing some of your own food can help a lot to the environment. Starting a vegetable or fruit garden may be a bit costly,
				however you spend less on eating because you hae a food source right in your backyard.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Preserve Food</h3>
				<p>Did you know that by pickling, drying, or bottling food, it is more effective at preserving food than a refrigerator? Yes,
				and the refrigerator adds to your electricity bill, so that's something you can do.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Reduce Waste</h3>
				<p>Stop throwing away plastics! They harm the environment because they take long to decompose! That is why it can be a better
				suggestion to turn those trash into fertilizer using composting, and this can decrease the amount of Co2 in the environment,
				which is good.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Insulate Houses</h3>
				<p>It is a good idea to insulate houses to balance the warmness and coolness of houses. An example of this is 
				planting trees around the house to shade it from harsh sunlight.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Use public transport.</h3>
				<p>Do not use your car becasuse it is producing gas that pollutes the earth. Walk to the location or bike. I know some people
				who could really take that advice for exercise.</p>
			</li>
